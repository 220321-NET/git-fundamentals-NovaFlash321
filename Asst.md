What I have learned so far is how to create local, remote, and .git
directories using Git Bash and VSCode. Along with creating repositories,
I have also learned to push and pull repositories to my local repo.

What I am still currently confused on is the layout of Bash and VSCode. It 
will take time to get used to for sure.
